## Technologies Used

- **.NET 8**: The latest version of the .NET framework, used for building high-performance, cross-platform applications.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **ASP.NET Core**: A framework for building web applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies data access by letting you work with relational data using domain-specific objects.
- **Postgres**: The database used for persisting and getting data.
- **RabbitMQ**: A message broker that allows you to send and receive messages between distributed systems.
- **FluentValidation**: A library for building strongly-typed validation rules.
- **Prometheus**: is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, used to get metrics about the app.
- **Grafana**: is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, used to create the dashboards with Prometheus metrics.

2. Navigate to the root directory.
3. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
4. Run the command `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal
5. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8888`
6. The Grafana will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and use the user admin and password admin.

## Getting Started With local app
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `src/Fiap.TechChallenge.Api` directory.
3. Run `dotnet restore` to restore the NuGet packages.
4. Update the connection string in the `launchSettings.json` file.
5. Run `dotnet run` to start the application.

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5010` and `https://localhost:7010`.

## Running only the app With Docker
1. Navigate to the root directory.
2. Run `docker build -t tech-challenge-api .` to start the application.
3. Run `docker run --name tech-challenge-api -p 5010:80 -d tech-challenge-api` to start the container.
4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5010`.

## Running Migrations
1. Navigate to the `src/Fiap.TechChallenge.Infrastructure` directory.
2. Add the following code in the `ContactDbContext`:
3. `protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql("Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=postgres;Username=postgres;Password=123456");
    }`
4. Run the following commands to create the database and run the migrations.
5. `docker-compose up -d`
6. `cd .\src\Fiap.TechChallenge.Infrastructure\`
7. `dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration`
8. `dotnet ef database update `
9. The database will be created and the tables will be created.
10. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5010` and `https://localhost:7010`.

## Running the Tests
1. Navigate to the `src/Fiap.TechChallenge.Tests` directory.
2. Run `dotnet test` to run the tests.
3. The test results will be displayed in the console.
